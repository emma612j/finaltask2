Overview
This project is part of Exercise 16 of our Spring Framework practice series. In Task 2, we develop a basic Java application using the Spring Framework with annotations for dependency injection and configuration. This task introduces the use of @Component, @Autowired, and Spring's annotation-based configuration.

Features
Demonstrates the use of:

@Component for bean declaration

@Autowired for automatic dependency injection

@ComponentScan and @Configuration for setting up Spring context

Clean and minimal setup with no XML configuration

Simple Java classes (MessageService, MessagePrinter) wired using Spring annotations

Requirements
Java 8 or higher

Maven or Gradle for build automation (or compile manually with javac)

Spring Framework (context module)
Key Spring Concepts Used
@Component: Marks classes as Spring-managed components.

@Autowired: Injects dependencies automatically.

@ComponentScan: Scans specified package for annotated components.

AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: Initializes Spring context with Java configuration.
